# OptimalBinarySearchTree
The Program only displays time completion for each input run i.e 10, 100, and so on keys in the OptimalBST(double[] p, double[] q, int n) method. The program also informs the user that the generated probabilities and e, w, and root matrix are saved. Navigate to the proper files to find needed information.
